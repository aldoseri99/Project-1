### **_Description_**

Itâ€™s a classic Snake-style game where you control a sandworm moving around the board, trying to eat the apple while avoiding collisions with yourself or the edges of the board. There are three levels: Snake (slowest), Sandworm (medium speed), and Python (fastest). A hidden level called "Cowboy" will unlock if the score in the Python level exceeds 100 score point.
